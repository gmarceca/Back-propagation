## Inputs Description

### Ej1: Breast Cancer Diagnostics

This data contains results from studies used to diagnose cancer tumors. Each entry correspond for different patients and contains 10 features obtained from digital images on cell samples. The information about the final diagnostic result is also present, which was determined using specific tests, it is cataloged as benign or malign. The reference table of each feature is shown below.

1. Radius (distance from the center to the edge of the perimeter) 
2. Texture (standard deviation of the values on a grayscale)
3. Perimeter
4. Area
5. Smoothness (local variations of the radius distance)
6. Compacity (perimeter^2/area - 1)
7. Concavity
8. Concave points
9. Symmetry
10. Density
11. Result: Final diagnostic (M = malign, B = bening)

### Ej2: Energy Efficiency

This data contains features of buildings which were used to determine the energy needed in order to heat or refrigerate the place.
It consists of 8 attributes and 2 results for calefaction and refrigeration.

1. Relative Compacity
2. Total Area
3. Walls Area
4. Roof Area
5. Total Height
6. Orientation
7. Total Reflective Area
8. Reflective Area Distribution
9. Result: Heating Energy
10. Result: Cooling Energy
